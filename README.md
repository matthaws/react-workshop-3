# Over-"React"-ing

# React Workshop 10/5/2018

## Learning Goals

Coming out of bootcamp, what you've done so far with React is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg of everything you can and should know about this still-super-popular framework. We'll cover tools and practices for React development ranging from "nice to know" all the way to "you really should be using this ASAP".

We'll talk about and demo:

### React features

- [PropTypes & defaultProps](src/components/propTypes)
- [Fragment](src/components/fragments)

### Design Patterns

- [Higher Order Components and Render Props](src/components/higherOrderComponents)

### Utilities to read about!

- create-react-app
- transform-class-properties babel plugin
- STORYBOOK! https://github.com/storybooks/storybook

### Javascript stuff to read about!

- Fetch (instead of `$.ajax`, native way to make AJAX calls)
- Async/await syntax (a huge improvement from `.then` syntax for Promises)
- Object rest and spread operator (...)
